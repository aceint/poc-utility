# ðŸ“° Web Article Scraper API

## Overview

The **Web Article Scraper API** is a FastAPI-based web application that allows users to extract structured information from online articles. This API accepts a URL, scrapes the article, and returns key metadata such as the article's title, authors, publish date, text content, summary, keywords, and more. It uses the popular Python library **newspaper3k** to handle the scraping, and provides an easy-to-use API interface for developers to interact with.

This project serves as a backend scraper service and is ideal for applications that need to automatically retrieve and analyze articles, such as content aggregators, news websites, or research tools.
