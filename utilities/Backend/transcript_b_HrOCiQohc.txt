1.68s: Let's face it: transcribing music by ear is tough. 
Maybe you have an old recording of a piano and  
8.58s: you just can't figure out what they played. So 
what do we do either you can go traditional and  
14.10s: you sit down listen to it over and over and 
over and over again, trying to transcribe it  
19.68s: by ear, Until you realize you spend your whole 
day doing that... Or you can use the power of *Artificial Intelligence*
26.28s: So in this video I will show you the easiest 
and fastest way on how to transcribe your  
33.18s: music with absolutely zero effort. Alright 
first off you'll need your files that you  
38.28s: want to transcribe over here I have a couple 
old recordings which sound a little like this.
43.14s: Beautiful! Next up, click on the first link that 
I've provided to you in the description below  
53.52s: which, leads you to the Klangio website now 
we'll scroll down a little until we find  
59.04s: Piano2Notes and click on learn more and in this 
section down here you can upload your files  
65.34s: simply by dragging and dropping them into this 
little window right here. Now we'll add the title
72.96s: .... and agree 
to the terms and conditions.
82.20s: And we can leave the additional information blank 
just as they are. And all that's left is click on  
88.26s: transcribe, and we're done! Easy as that (cat cheers). So while 
the AI does its magic I should also point out  
94.92s: that you can also provide YouTube links instead of 
files as you can see down here asides from piano  
101.40s: to notes there are other applications like Sing2Notes and Guitar2Tabs which as you might have  
108.72s: already guessed are for playing guitar or singing. 
And all these applications aren't just available  
114.12s: for your browser but also for Android and iOS you 
can find links to all of the applications in the  
120.48s: description below and the transcription is done. 
Didn't even take a minute let's see the results [Music]  
135.72s: that seems pretty on point to me. Of course you 
have to keep in mind that the AI sometimes  
141.24s: makes mistakes but we're constantly working 
on improving it now if that's all you need  
146.22s: you can click on download and Export the PDF. 
But wait.... THERE IS MORE! As you might have noticed  
153.18s: you can also transcribe more than 30 seconds and 
download further formats like MIDI and musicXML,  
158.82s: when you upgrade to our Pro Models and since I'm 
happy with the first 30 seconds of the file. I'm  
164.22s: going to log into my account and transcribe the 
full song and here we are now we have access to  
169.32s: the transcription of the whole song and we can 
download all the formats there are. Thank you very
